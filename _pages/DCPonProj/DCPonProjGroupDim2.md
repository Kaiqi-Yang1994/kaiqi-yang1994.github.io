In this page, there is a list of all finite groups of $\rm{PGL}(3,\mathbb{C})$ acting on Project space $\mathbb{P}^2$,(see section 10 in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.00518.pdf">EQUIVARIANT BURNSIDE GROUPS AND
REPRESENTATION THEORY</a>)

${\em Intransitive}$ subgroup: the representation is reducible and has the form $G=C_n \times G'$ where $G' \subset GL_2$.

${\em transitive but imprimitive}$: the action is not transitive, but there is a nontrivial normal subgroup of $G$ acting intransitively.
They are 



It is well known that a finite primitive subgroup of $\rm{PGL}(3,\mathbb{C})$ is isomorphic to one of the following groups:
* $A_5$ of order 60,
* $A_6$ of order 360,
* $PSL_2(\mathbb{F}_7)$ of order 168,
* the Hession group $ASL_2(\mathbb{F}_3)$ of order 216,
* A subgroup of Hessian group, $PSU_3(\mathbb{F}_2)$ of order 72,
* A subgroup of Hessian group, $C3:S3.C2$ of order 36.

The explicit generators of group $G$ and the Burnside symbol of $G$ acting on $\mathbb{P}^1$ are given in the following pages:
