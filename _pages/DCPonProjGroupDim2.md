In this page, there is a list of all finite groups of $PGL(2,\mathbb{C})$ acting on Project space $\mathbb{P}^2$.

It is well known that a finite subgroup of $PGL(2,\mathbb{C})$ is isomorphic to one of the following groups:
* a cyclic group $C_n$;
* a dihedral group $D_{n}$ of order $2n$, $n \geq 2$;
* the tetrahedral group $A_4$ of order 12;
* the octahedral group $S_4$ of order 24;
* the icosahedral group $A_5$ of order 60.

The explicit generators of group $G$ and the Burnside symbol of $G$ acting on $\mathbb{P}^2$ are given in the following pages:
